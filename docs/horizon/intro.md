# Bot Documenation
Welcome to the Horizon bot documentation! Here you will learn how to use the core functions of the bot. If you already know how the bot works, you can skip this section.

## What is Horizon?

Horizon is a open-source Discord bot written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It's lightweight and easy to use, and it's free, no premium at all.

## Getting Started

### Invite the bot to your server
*If you know how this works, you can skip the section.*

Fistly, you'll need to add the bot to your server. You can do this by going to the [dashboard](https://horizon.trtle.xyz/dashboard), scroll down to the server you want and just click "Setup". Then you'll be redirected to Discord's OAuth page, go ahead and click "Continue" after that it will show you the permissions that the bot needs. The permissions has been auto-generated from the bot depending permissions that are needed from the commands.

> If you're worried about the permissions, you can read our [Privacy Policy](https://horizon.trtle.xyz/privacy-policy), which explains how we handle your data. 

All you need to do is click "Authorize" and the bot will be added to your server.
